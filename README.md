# Unified settings in the interpretation of cross-domain remote sensing scenes（Scene recognition and Target Recognition）
# Introduction：
  Due to the lack of cross-domain benchmark datasets for remote sensing scene interpretation, in order to effectively evaluate the performance of remote sensing scene and target cross-domain recognition 	
models,existing methods usually simulate cross-domain scenarios based on multiple remote sensing dataset screening categories. 
  In this work, we suggest a unified cross-domain setup and try to perform a unified cross-domain setupfor remote sensing scene and target recognition datasets to facilitate the subsequent research in this field. 
In this project, we provide a cross-domain remote sensing dataset with a unified setup, and 
select some mainstream methods to do some simple comparative experiments on this dataset and the corresponding evaluation indexes, the specific information can be found in the following citations for more
